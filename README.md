# Tokenized Asset Fund

## Introduction

## Technology

- [Standard ERC20](https://docs.openzeppelin.com/contracts/4.x/erc20) since we want our tokenized fund share to be fungible, me make it compliant to this standard
- [Ownable contract](https://docs.openzeppelin.com/contracts/2.x/access-control) so we have power over access control
- [SafeMath](https://docs.openzeppelin.com/contracts/2.x/api/math) to perform sound mathematical operation because we are operating with unsigned integers only
- [Uniswap](https://docs.uniswap.org/) to give us access to an automated market maker, liquidity pools and pairs
- [Ganache](https://trufflesuite.com/ganache/) to create a dummy blockchain on which to test our contract
- [Remix](https://remix.ethereum.org/) as a compiler and to deploy compiled smart contracts
